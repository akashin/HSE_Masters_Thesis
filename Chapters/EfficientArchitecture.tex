\section{Efficient architecture}

- Description of more efficient architecture, and questions that we need to
  answer to build it. Compare with PAAC, GA3C, tell when one is better then
  the other and vice versa.

In this section we describe:
- Tell that this is our new ideas.
- Tell how it looks like. Simple description of the process in terms of multiple CPU and 1 GPU.
- Tell how this compares to other architectures, in what regimes it should operate better then
the other algorithms.
- Tell about resulting GPU utilization and time spent in different modes of operation.
- Tell about existing bottlenecks, what will be the limiting factor depending on the env speed,
training speed, network size.
- Tell how this is applicable to DQN and ACER (and any algorithm with experience replay, or
slightly off-policy data tolerance).
