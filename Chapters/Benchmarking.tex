\section{Benchmarking}

- Comparison of DQN, DecoupledDQN on VizDoom.
- Comparison of DQN, DecoupledDQN on Atari, at least few games. Hopefully as much as possible.

In this section we show:
- Description of the evaluation setup, how long the models trained, which hardware was used,
which networks were used. Any specifics of the traning procedure. Sizes of the replay tables,
learning rates.

- Graphs of DQN, DecoupledDQN performance on 5 VizDoom Gym levels.

- Graphs of DQN, DecoupledDQN performance on 3 Atari games.

- Explanation what is on the graph, how we made the measurements robust to the noise (choosing top 5
from several random seeds).

- Explanation why the algorithms perform as they do. Study on how hyperparameters influence
the performance both in terms of training speed and efficiency.

- How the methods perform in terms of wall time/sample efficiency.
