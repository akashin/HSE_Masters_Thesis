% Section about hardware and utilization

- GPU vs CPU for training, motivation, comparison of performance, support
  from different frameworks, cost, restrictions, dependence on the size of
  the network. Sampling on CPU is fine, but parallelism is very bad.
  Mention last paper by FaceBook about ImageNet. Mention the paper Learning
  to play in a day.
