\section{Conclusion}

We have introduced a new training architecture Decoupled DQN that removes the blocking
between prediction and training in DQN and allows to take full advantage of CPU and GPU resources.
This architecture is able to solve tasks with highly visual input in VizDoom and Atari benchmarks,
and performs better then DQN on Atari tasks.
