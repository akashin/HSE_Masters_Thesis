\section{Conclusion}

We have demonstrated that it's possible to efficiently train deep reinforcement learning model to control an agent on task with raw pixel representation of the input space coming from modern physics-based game engine.
Our approach is able to utilize the highly optimized game engine to perform physics computation and environment simulation, while using modern machine learning framework supporting acceleration of training with dedicated hardware. 

This provides a basis to apply the same approach for training a model to perform control in first-person shooter implemented in the same game engine.
