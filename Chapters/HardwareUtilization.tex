\section{Hardware utilization}

- Describe how and why current algorithms underutilize the hardware, and how
  improvement there can speedup the training. Tell the arising challenge with
  batch size and learning rate. Find the papers that discuss this (no-one does
  this!!! or so I think). Graphs about utilization of hardware with
  different batch size and train frequency in DQN here.
