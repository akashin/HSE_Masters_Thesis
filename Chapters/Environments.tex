\section{Environments}

% Section about environments and their performance
Environments - describe why simulated environments are used, what kind of
tasks they simulate, how they range in Accuracy, Performance, Complexity,
Usability.

In this section we will describe:
- What is the environment from RL perspective (state transition function, rewards).
- What are the examples of simulated environments (ALE, Mujoco, StarCraft).
- Why simulated environments are important for RL research? (Safe exploration, a lot of data,
adjustable complexity, well scoped skills testing, access to privilliged information).
- How simulated environments are commonly implemented, and what implication this brings?
(limited accuracy, limited speed, limited diversity (in case of opponents in board games))
- Which environments are used for benchmarking algorithms? (Atari, Mujoco).
- Other notable progress in environments development: DeepMind Lab, VizDoom, StarCraft 2.
- How this work addresses is connected to different environments: we build an adaptive algorithm,
that can take into account the speed of the environment.
- Tell more about environments used in this work: VizDoom.
